PyTorch implementations of GSM, GSB, RSB-TF in [Discovering Discrete Latent Topics with Neural Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00359.pdf).

## Data
Dataset should consists of a `list of text` in `json` format.

## Usage
```
GSM_run.py --config config/pluralist_safe_water_all.yaml
```

## Acknowledgements
GSM code & framework is taken and modified from https://github.com/zll17/Neural_Topic_Models.
